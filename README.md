![screenshot](./src/assets/images/screenshot.png)

- Where can I see your demo?

  @ netlify, you can visit [https://dev-challenge-country-quiz.netlify.app/](https://dev-challenge-country-quiz.netlify.app/)

- What was your experience?

  bit confused at choosing state management, but at last I choose react's useReducer + immer for managing state, to too fancy but works as expected.

- What have you learned/improved?

  I have learn about using state machine logic for managing states is better than using boolean values. Also this is my first time using audio effects at web, it's fun !

- Your wisdom?

  as long as is works, it's fine.
